# CityPulse - Disaster Management System
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 🔥 **The Problem**

### Current Disaster Management Challenges:
- **Fragmented Communication**: Multiple agencies operate in silos during disasters, leading to delayed responses and resource duplication
- **Lack of Real-time Intelligence**: Emergency responders rely on outdated information, hindering effective decision-making
- **Inefficient Resource Management**: No centralized system to track critical supplies (medical equipment, food, water, rescue tools) across departments
- **Poor Predictive Capabilities**: Reactive approach to disasters instead of proactive risk assessment and prevention
- **Limited Coordination**: Fire departments, medical teams, rescue units, and relief organizations struggle to coordinate effectively
- **Data Accessibility**: Critical disaster information is scattered across different systems and not easily accessible to field workers
- **Manual Processes**: Paper-based inventory tracking and reporting leading to errors and delays during critical situations

### Impact of Current System:
- **Delayed Emergency Response**: Average response time increased by 40% due to poor coordination
- **Resource Wastage**: 30% of emergency supplies expire or go unused due to poor tracking
- **Duplicated Efforts**: Multiple agencies deploy to same locations while other areas remain unserviced
- **Poor Risk Assessment**: Inability to predict and prevent disasters like forest fires before they spread
- **Communication Gaps**: Critical information doesn't reach field workers in time
